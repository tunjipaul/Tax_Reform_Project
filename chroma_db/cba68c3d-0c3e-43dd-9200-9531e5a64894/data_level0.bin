for any two or more transactions comprised in one bargain, whether transactions
whereby assets are disposed of or not, those considerations shall be treated as
altogether constituting an entire consideration for the transactions and shall be

tion being attributed to the chargeable asset than that agreed or purported to
be agreed, in the bargain, the separate considerations shall be the consideration
for which those assets are disposed of.First
